# PFHub: The Phase Field Community Hub
*Integrating the phase field community*

Welcome to the PFHub! If you're a [beginner](about:novice), you'll soon find resources and
a crash course on the technique. If you're an [expert](about:expert), you'll find tools to
verify and showcase the quality of your simulations. If you're anywhere
[in-between](about:intermediate), you'll find a community built around a shared interest in
phase-field and a commitment to opening up our research for the benefit of all.
If you're just getting started implementing a Phase Field example, then the
[recommended practices guide](https://pages.nist.gov/pf-recommended-practices/intro.html)
is a great place to start.
